## The Open Data
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This folder contains the **Open Data** collected from different continents.

The folder name indicates the sequence number of its inside trajectory. Each trajectory folder includes four files: map files (xxx.arcs and xxx.nodes), a trajectory file (xxx.track) and a map matched route file (xxx.route) which could be used as the ground truth route.

The **Open Data** could also be found online by [clicking here](https://zenodo.org/record/57731#.Y9tu2XbP2Hs).
